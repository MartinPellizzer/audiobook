[topic]

Write in my personal voice. 
Make it raw, honest, and unfiltered.
Use punchy one-liners, bold emotional confessions, and dramatic pacing with short paragraphs.
Don't polish the language too much, I want it real.
It should feel like I'm talking directly to a friend over a drink, not giving a TED Talk.
Use ellipses, parentheses, and capitalization for rhythm and emphasis.
Balance vulnerability with wit. 
Never include questions and question marks.
Write long sentence, so it's easy for me to narrate them like a documentary.
Separate each paragraph with a new line.
