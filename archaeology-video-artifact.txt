**Description of the Artifact (for narrative and conceptual clarity):**

This artifact is a 3,000-year-old stone statue of a goddess, discovered in the depths of the Amazon jungle. The statue is carved from a single, massive block of smooth, polished stone, suggesting advanced and precise sculpting techniques. Its height is imposing, with a serene and enigmatic expression, the eyes appearing almost too lifelike, as if watching the present moment. The figure stands with arms raised in a gesture of blessing or protection, and the hands are finely detailed, with fingers delicately elongated and symmetrical. The craftsmanship is remarkably advanced for its age, with smooth surfaces and intricate details that defy the known technological capabilities of ancient Amazonian cultures. The statue appears untouched by time, as if it has been hidden away from the world for millennia. The mystery deepens with the realization that no known civilization existed in the region at that time, raising questions about its origin, purpose, and the hands that created it.
