You are the worlds best youtube video writer expert.

I want you to write an outline for a 5-minute youtube video with the following title, sections, and guidelines.

TITLE:
This One Tool Made My Herbal Tea Taste 10x Better. I Had No Idea!

SECTIONS:
- HOOK [0-15 seconds]
- HISTORICAL ANECDOTE/STORY, based on a real event, including people, location, and period [15-60 seconds]. 
- BODY of the video (split it into 3 main section, each one about 1 minute), These sections are what, why, and how to. For the how to, give only one way to do it. Describe it in actionable and specific details.
- CONCLUSION (about one minute) (drive the point home with the video) 
- CTA (about 30 seconds) (the CTA must be about asking them a relevant question to make them comment, don't tell you're going to try what they suggest in the comments, instead tell that his can help/inspire others).

GUIDELINES:
Don't reveal "the what" in the hook.
The hook and the anecdote goal is to build curiosity.
Reveal the "the what" in the last sentence of the anecdote, as a way to transition in the next section.





Write the full script.

Write it using long sentences, long enough to cover about 10-seconds of narration, because I want to be able to narrate them in documentary style.
Separate each sentence in a new line.
Each sentence is a scene of the video.

Also, I need to create an image with stable diffusion in each scene, so give me prompt for stable diffusion before each sentence [in brackets] where you describe the scene to generate the image.
Each image prompt must start with the words "a watercolor painting of " and include a main subject and a description of the background scenery based on the current scene (sentence), using less than 10 words. 
For the image prompts, include only tags that are well recognized by stable diffusion.
Never include tags that will generate people or body parts like hands.

Example of image prompt structures you can take inspiration from are:
- A watercolor painting of melissa officinalis herb in a Italian garden
- A watercolor painting of a cup of tea in a cottage

Reply in 1000 words, only with the content asked, without titles.
