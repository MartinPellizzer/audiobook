Her "Simple" Recipe Nearly Broke My Brain

Dear Apothecary,

You ever have a moment where someone drops a sentence so casual, so innocent... and your whole brain just short-circuits? Yeah. That.

So picture this...

I'm standing in my grandma's kitchen, the one that always smells like chamomile, old wood, and the slightest hint of something she "forgot" simmering on the stove.

She's stirring this little pot of what she calls her "simple" remedy. 

Simple. That's the word she uses. 

Then she starts explaining it to me like she's reading from some ancient scroll:

"Oh, you just pluck the flowers before the sun gets too proud, dry them until they sound like brittle laughter, crush them just enough... but not too much... then add a whisper of honey and a spoon of the water from the first boil, not the second..."

And I'm standing there nodding like, "Totally. Obviously. That all makes perfect sense." (Meanwhile my entire soul is yelling: What in the world does "sun gets too proud" mean?)

Half the instructions sounded like a secret code only passed down through a dream.

And here's the thing... you've probably been there too. 

Someone shows you how to make a remedy, or heal your own body, or craft something with herbs... and suddenly you feel like you missed the class where everyone else got the manual.

You start thinking:

"I don't know enough."
"I'll mess it up."
"I'm not ready to make my own remedies."

But here's the part nobody says out loud:

People feel this way because we've been taught that knowledge only counts when it comes from a book, a certificate, or someone with a podium. 

We forget that we've been learning through life the whole time. Through our senses. Through our hands. Through the tiny, ordinary things we do without even realizing they count.

So let me flip this for you...

You might feel like you don't know enough to make your own remedies. But the truth is, you already know more than you realize. 

Every time you've brewed a soothing tea, used a comforting salve, or cooked with healing herbs, you've taken small but meaningful steps toward becoming your own herbalist.

Making remedies isn't about knowing everything. It's about building on what you already do naturally.

Start small, follow simple recipes, and watch your confidence grow with each jar, tincture, or infusion you create.

You are more capable than you think.

Seriously. Give yourself that credit.

And if you mess up? That's part of the magic. Herbs forgive us more than we forgive ourselves.

Stay Grounded,

Leen

P.S. Funny enough, when I finally asked Grandma what "sun gets too proud" meant, she laughed and said, "Oh honey, it just means after ten in the morning." (Turns out the real secret code... wasn't a secret at all.)
